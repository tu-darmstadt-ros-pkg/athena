## ATHENA CAD design

This directory contains the CAD files for the Rescue Robot ATHENA. The accompanying documentation outlines each component, its material specification, and the recommended manufacturing process.

The provided CAD model is compatible with Autodesk Fusion 360, and all components are integrated within a single comprehensive assembly file.

**Important** Before importing the model into Fusion 360, ensure that a dedicated folder is created for the project files.

## CAD Description

The primary file, main_assembly, represents the complete mechanical assembly of ATHENA. It includes all sub-assemblies and defines their kinematic and structural relationships.

Both the Flipper and Arm sub-assemblies are fully articulated within the model. They can be repositioned interactively and will automatically return to their defined resting configurations.

ATHENA consists of the following major sub-assemblies:

- sub_assembly_chassis: Composed of bonded and fastened carbon fiber composite (CFK) panels forming the primary load-bearing chassis of the robot.

- four sub_assembly_tracked_drive: Four identical tracked drive units, each integrating a drive motor, drive pulley, and flipper sub-assembly.

- two sub_assembly_battery_box: Two identical removable battery modules, each designed to accommodate a pair of 4S LiPo batteries for modular power management.

- assembly_arm_7_DoF: A 7-DoF manipulator assembly. Each joint includes predefined motion constraints, allowing spatial motion simulation and evaluation of various operational configurations.

## ATHENA Parts, Materials & Manufacturing Specification

This section lists all mechanical components of ATHENA, organized by sub-assembly. Each table specifies the part name, material, recommended manufacturing process, and additional notes.
